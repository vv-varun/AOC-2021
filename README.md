[Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) Solutions

I was introduced to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenge by my colleagues... Intially, I thought that its just another coding challenge... but after day 1 and 2 I liked the puzzles and decided to continue on... 

I thought of documenting my solutions..

## Build & Run
No build required. Just run directly.

To run : `node index.js <day>`

For e.g. to run the Day1 puzzle.. run the command: `node index.js day1`

Alternatively, you could also simply run : `node day1/day1.js`

## Why JavaScript
Just like that. 

FYI - The first few puzzles, I solved in MS Excel (you can use any other spreadsheet software)


### Note
- This is just an one of the many ways these puzzles can be solved.. 
- I often take the approach that comes as a first to my mind.. 
- My intention is not to write optimized code (fast runtime, less memory etc). 
- My intention is just to solve the puzzle so that I can get those 2 stars :) 
- I do this outside my regular officework.. so please be prepared that solutions may come when I get time :)
